abstract = {Abstract Climate change is profoundly affecting nearly all aspects of life on earth, including human societies, economies, and health. Various human activities are responsible for significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including data centers and other sources of large-scale computation. Although many important scientific milestones are achieved thanks to the development of high-performance computing, the resultant environmental impact is underappreciated. In this work, a methodological framework to estimate the carbon footprint of any computational task in a standardized and reliable way is presented and metrics to contextualize GHG emissions are defined. A freely available online tool, Green Algorithms (www.green-algorithms.org) is developed, which enables a user to estimate and report the carbon footprint of their computation. The tool easily integrates with computational processes as it requires minimal information and does not interfere with existing code, while also accounting for a broad range of hardware configurations. Finally, the GHG emissions of algorithms used for particle physics simulations, weather forecasts, and natural language processing are quantified. Taken together, this study develops a simple generalizable framework and freely available tool to quantify the carbon footprint of nearly any computation. Combined with recommendations to minimize unnecessary CO2 emissions, the authors hope to raise awareness and facilitate greener computation.},

abstract = {The decarbonization of energy systems is a major challenge that requires complex cross-sectoral strategies that need to be supported by energy modeling. As many technologies rely on electricity, an accurate estimation of its CO2 intensity is of utmost importance for the reliability of modeling results. When electricity is generated from fossil sources, its CO2 intensity depends on several parameters. This research paper presents an hourly calculation of the CO2 intensity of power generation from natural gas combined cycles, based on real data from several years of operation of three plants. As these plants are also operated in combined heat and power mode, two alternative allocation methods are compared. The results confirm the variability of CO2 intensity based on the different operation strategies of the plants and the share of heat and electricity generated. The hourly analysis shows average values in the range of 230–250 gCO2/kWh in winter, rising to around 330–370 gCO2/kWh in summer. The real CO2 intensity profiles presented in this paper can be integrated into energy planning models to improve their ability to estimate the potential benefits of different decarbonization solutions by including the effect of the operational profiles over the day and the year.}

This is because current methodologies require extensive data input and significant human effort to complete. We propose &nbsp;EasyC&nbsp;, a novel, simple carbon accounting framework and tool, that starts from minimal data and effort, and can voluntarily be refined with additional information. We describe &nbsp;EasyC&nbsp;and evaluate its effort and accuracy, showing with only a few counts, estimation errors of less than 30\% for operational carbon emissions and 20\% for embodied carbon emissions can be achieved. With the addition of a few statistics, these errors can be reduced in some cases to near 0\%.},

    abstract = {Efficient resource utilization is a critical yet challenging problem in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, particularly in GPU-accelerated workloads. GPUs have become indispensable in modern datacenters, powering applications in AI, scientific computing, and large-scale simulations, but their potential is often hindered by imbalances in resource allocation and utilization. These inefficiencies across GPUs and nodes can lead to significant performance degradation and energy wastage. While existing works analyze resource utilization at a coarse level, they often fail to capture the intricate temporal and spatial imbalances present in multi-node GPU jobs. In this work, we analyze GPU jobs executed on the Perlmutter supercomputer, a GPU-accelerated system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), using telemetry data from one month of operation in 2024. We identify inefficiencies in how resources are allocated and utilized across GPU nodes and GPUs within nodes. We propose novel methodologies to quantify these imbalances using refined metrics that capture both spatial and temporal variations in resource utilization. Our analysis reveals that GPU utilization is generally well-balanced temporally for most jobs, with no significant temporal imbalances observed. However, GPU memory utilization remains consistently low across many jobs, highlighting opportunities to optimize resource allocation and improve memory usage efficiency.},
